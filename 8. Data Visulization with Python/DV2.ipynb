You will also need a `years_for_plotting` list, typically defined as `years_for_plotting = [y for y in range(1980, 2014)]` if year columns are integers, or `[str(y) for y in range(1980, 2014)]` if they are strings.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Area plots** are graphical displays of quantitative data, particularly useful for showing how one or more quantities change over a continuous axis, usually time. [Source: 3] They are like line plots, but the space between the axis and the line is filled with color. This fill helps to emphasize the volume or cumulative magnitude of the data over the progression. [Source: 4]\n",

        "Area plots shine when you want to:\n",
        "* Compare the change in two or more quantities over time. [Source: 5]\n",
        "* Depict cumulative data, like tracking stock market performance, changes in population demographics, or resource distribution over time. [Source: 6]\n",

        "Pandas DataFrames make creating area plots simple with the `.plot(kind='area')` method. [Source: 8]\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Data Structure:** Often, your data needs to be structured correctly. For example, if you want to plot trends over years (with years on the x-axis), and your DataFrame has years as columns and categories (like countries) as rows, you'll likely need to **transpose** it. This makes years the index and categories the columns. [Source: 9, 10]\n",
        "* **Transparency (`alpha`):** The `alpha` parameter sets the transparency of the filled areas (a value between 0 for fully transparent and 1 for fully opaque). This is handy when plotting multiple series that might overlap, especially if they are not stacked. [Source: 11]\n",
        "* **Stacked Area Plots:** By default, when you plot multiple columns, Pandas creates a **stacked area plot**. [Source: 12] In these plots, the values for each category are stacked on top of one another. [Source: 13] This is excellent for showing both the total magnitude and the proportional contribution of each category to that total over time. [Source: 14]\n",
        "    [*Diagram: Illustration of a stacked area plot with 3 categories. Category A is at the bottom, Category B is stacked on A, and Category C is stacked on B. The top line represents the total.*]\n",
