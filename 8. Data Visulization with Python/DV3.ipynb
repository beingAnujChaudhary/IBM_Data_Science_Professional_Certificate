        "Waffle charts present an alternative, often more intuitive, method for showing proportions in categorical data, especially when compared to pie charts. [Source: 2] They use a grid of equal-sized square tiles, where each tile represents a specific unit or category. The number or color of these tiles indicates the magnitude or proportion.
