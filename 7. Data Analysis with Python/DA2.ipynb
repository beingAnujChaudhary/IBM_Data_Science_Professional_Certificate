Matplotlib provides the foundational plotting capabilities, while Seaborn offers a higher-level interface for creating more statistically sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing plots with less code.\n","\n","**5.1 Introduction to Matplotlib**\n","\n","Matplotlib is a comprehensive and highly versatile plotting library. The `matplotlib.pyplot` module is a collection of functions that make Matplotlib work like MATLAB, providing a convenient state-based interface to create plots and visualizations. *[6]*\n","\n","* **Core Concepts:**\n","    * **Figure:** The top-level container for all plot elements (titles, axes, legends, etc.). A single `Figure` can contain multiple `Axes` (subplots). *[6]*\n","    * **Axes:** An `Axes` object represents an individual plot or chart within a `Figure`. It's the region where data is actually plotted. An `Axes` has its own coordinate system and contains `Axis` objects (for x-axis, y-axis, and potentially z-axis) which handle the data limits, ticks, and tick labels. Each `Axes` can have a title, an x-label, and a y-label. *[6]*\n","    * **Artist:** Virtually everything you see on a Matplotlib figure is an `Artist` (e.g., `Text` objects for labels, `Line2D` objects for lines, `Patch` objects for shapes). This provides a high degree of control. *[6]*\n","* **Basic Plotting Workflow (using `pyplot`):**\n","    1.  **Import:** `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`\n","    2.  **Prepare Data:** Have your data ready (e.g., in NumPy arrays or Pandas Series/DataFrames).\n","    3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Create Figure and Axes:**\n","        * `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` (for a single plot)\n","        * `fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=..., ncols=...)` (for multiple subplots)\n","    4.  **Plot Data:** Use `Axes` methods to plot data (e.g., `ax.plot()`, `ax.scatter()`, `ax.bar()`, `ax.hist()`). Or, use `pyplot` functions directly (e.g., `plt.plot()`), which act on the \"current\" axes.\n","    5.  **Customize:** Add titles, labels, legends, change colors, styles, etc. (e.g., `ax.set_title()`, `ax.set_xlabel()`, `ax.legend()`, `plt.title()`).\n","    6.  **Show Plot:** `plt.show()` (displays the plot). In Jupyter Notebooks with `%matplotlib inline`, `plt.show()` is often not strictly necessary for the plot to appear, but it's good practice, especially in scripts.\n","\n","**5.2 Introduction to Seaborn**\n","\n","Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It integrates well with Pandas DataFrames and often simplifies the creation of complex visualizations that would require more code in Matplotlib. *[9]*\n","\n","* **Key Advantages over Matplotlib alone:**\n","    * **Simplified Syntax:** Easier syntax for common statistical plots (e.g., creating a regression plot with confidence intervals is one line).\n","    * **Better Default Aesthetics:** Comes with more visually appealing default styles, themes, and color palettes. *[9]*\n","    * **Pandas Integration:** Works seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames, allowing you to easily map DataFrame columns to plot aesthetics like x, y, hue, size, style. *[9]*\n","    * **Built-in Statistical Estimation:** Many Seaborn functions can automatically perform statistical estimation (like means, medians, confidence intervals, kernel density estimates) and display them on the plot.\n","\n","* **Basic Seaborn Workflow:**\n","    1.  **Import:** `import seaborn as sns` (and usually `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` as well for customization or showing plots).\n","    2.  **Prepare Data:** Typically a Pandas DataFrame.\n","    3.  **(Optional) Set Theme/Style:** `sns.set_theme(style=\"whitegrid\")` or `sns.set_style(\"darkgrid\")`.\n","    4.  **Plot Data:** Use Seaborn's high-level functions (e.g., `sns.histplot()`, `sns.boxplot()`, `sns.scatterplot()`, `sns.lineplot()`, `sns.heatmap()`), often passing the DataFrame to the `data` parameter and column names as strings to `x`, `y`, `hue`, etc.\n","    5.  **Customize (often using Matplotlib functions):** Add titles, labels, adjust limits using `plt` or `Axes` object methods.\n","    6.  **Show Plot:** `plt.show()`.\n","\n","**5.3 Common Plot Types**\n","\n","Let's prepare some sample data for plotting:"],"metadata":{"id":"IBZsikybmw1c"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Sample data for plotting demonstrations\n","np.random.seed(42) # for reproducibility\n","plot_data_numeric = np.random.randn(200) # More data points for better visuals\n","plot_data_numeric_positive = np.abs(np.random.randn(200) * 50 + 10) # Positive skewed data\n","plot_df = pd.DataFrame({\n","    'value_norm': plot_data_numeric,\n","    'value_pos': plot_data_numeric_positive,\n","    'category': np.random.choice(['Alpha', 'Bravo', 'Charlie', 'Delta'], 200),\n","    'value2_corr': plot_data_numeric * 0.7 + np.random.randn(200) * 0.5, # Correlated with value_norm\n","    'group': np.random.choice(['G1', 'G2'], 200)\n","})\n","print(\"Sample DataFrame for plotting (first 5 rows):\\n\", plot_df.head())"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"l-o9d0gKmw1d"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["* **Histograms:** Visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable.
