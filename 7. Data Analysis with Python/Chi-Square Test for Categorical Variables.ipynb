        "### Introduction\n",
        "The chi-square test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. This test is widely used in various fields, including social sciences, marketing, and healthcare, to analyze survey data, experimental results, and observational studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Concept\n",
        "The chi-square test is a non-parametric statistical method used to examine the association between two categorical variables. It evaluates whether the frequencies of observed outcomes significantly deviate from expected frequencies, assuming the variables are independent. The test is grounded in the chi-square distribution, which is applied to count data and helps in determining if any observed deviations could have arisen by random chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis\n",
        "The chi-square test involves formulating two hypotheses:\n",
        "**Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**\n",
        "($H_0$) - Assumes that there is no association between the categorical variables, implying that any observed differences are due to random chance.\n",
        "**Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**\n",
        "($H_1$) - Assumes that there is a significant association between the variables, indicating that the observed differences are not due to chance alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Formula\n",
        "The chi-square statistic is calculated using the formula:\n",
        "$$\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\n",
        "where\n",
        "$O_i$ is the observed frequency for category $i$.\n",
        "$E_i$ is the expected frequency for category $i$, calculated as:\n",
        "$$E_i = \\frac{(\\text{row total} \\times \\text{column total})}{\\text{grand total}}$$\n",
        "The sum is taken over all cells in the contingency table.\n",
        "The calculated chi-square statistic is then compared to a critical value from the chi-square distribution table. This table provides critical values for different degrees of freedom (df) and significance levels ($\\alpha$).\n",
        "The degrees of freedom for the test are calculated as:\n",
        "$$df = (r-1) \\times (c-1)$$\n",
        "where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns in the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Applications\n",
        "**Market Research:** Analyzing the association between customer demographics and product preferences.\n",
        "**Healthcare:** Studying the relationship between patient characteristics and disease incidence.\n",
        "**Social Sciences:** Investigating the link between social factors (e.g., education level) and behavioral outcomes (e.g., voting patterns).\n",
        "**Education:** Examining the connection between teaching methods and student performance.\n",

        "### Assumptions of the Chi-Square Test of Independence\n",
        "1.  **Two Categorical Variables:** The data should consist of counts for two categorical variables.\n",
        "2.  **Independence of Observations:** Each observation should be independent of all other observations (e.g., one participant's response does not affect another's).\n",
        "3.  **Sufficiently Large Expected Frequencies:** For the chi-square approximation to be valid, the expected frequencies in each cell of the contingency table should not be too small. A common rule of thumb is:\n",
        "    * No cell should have an expected frequency less than 1.\n",
        "    * At least 80% of the cells should have an expected frequency of 5 or more.\n",
        "    If these conditions are not met, especially for 2x2 tables, Fisher's Exact Test might be a better alternative. For larger tables, you might consider combining categories if it's theoretically sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Interpreting the p-value and Chi-Square Statistic\n",
        "* The **Chi-Square Statistic ($\\chi^2$)** measures the overall difference between observed and expected frequencies. A larger value generally indicates a greater discrepancy.\n",
        "* The **p-value** is the probability of observing the data (or more extreme data) if the null hypothesis (no association) were true.\n",
        "    * If **p-value < $\\alpha$** (your chosen significance level, e.g., 0.05): Reject $H_0$. There is a statistically significant association between the variables.\n",
        "    * If **p-value $\\ge \\alpha$**: Fail to reject $H_0$. There is not enough evidence to conclude a significant association between the variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Strength of Association (Brief Mention)\n",
        "While the chi-square test tells you if an association is statistically significant, it doesn't tell you how strong that association is. For 2x2 tables, the **Phi coefficient ($\\phi$)** can be used. For larger tables, **Cramer's V** is a common measure of association strength. Both typically range from 0 (no association) to 1 (perfect association)."
