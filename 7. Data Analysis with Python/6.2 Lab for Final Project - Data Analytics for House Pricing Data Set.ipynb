The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. You are tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. You will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. This is a template notebook; your job is to complete the ten questions. Some hints to the questions are given.\n","\n","As you are completing this notebook, take and save the **screenshots** of the final outputs of your solutions (e.g., final charts, tables, calculation results etc.).
