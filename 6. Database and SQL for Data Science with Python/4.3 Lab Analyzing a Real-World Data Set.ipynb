of socioeconomic data to the Chicago City Portal.\n","This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.\n","\n","Scores on the hardship index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship.\n","\n","A detailed description of the dataset can be found on [the city of Chicago's

(`community_area_name`): The name of the region in the city of Chicago\n","\n","*   **Percent of Housing Crowded** (`percent_of_housing_crowded`): Percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room\n","\n","*   **Percent Households Below Poverty** (`percent_households_below_poverty`): Percent of households living below the federal poverty line\n","\n","*   **Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed** (`percent_aged_16_unemployed`): Percent of persons over the age of 16 years that are unemployed\n","\n","*   **Percent Aged 25+ without High School Diploma** (`percent_aged_25_without_high_school_diploma`): Percent of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school education\n","\n","*   **Percent Aged Under** 18 or Over 64:Percent of population under 18 or over 64 years of age (`percent_aged_under_18_or_over_64`): (ie. dependents)\n","\n","*   **Per Capita Income** (`per_capita_income_`): Community Area per capita income is estimated as the sum of tract-level aggragate incomes divided by the total population\n","\n","*   **Hardship Index** (`hardship_index`): Score that incorporates each of the six selected socioeconomic indicators\n","\n","In this Lab, we'll take a look at the variables in the socioeconomic indicators dataset and do some basic analysis with
